# GitHub Copilot 4-Week Bootcamp (Interactive)

This repository is a **training template** for running a 4-week GitHub Copilot program.

## How this works
- Each week has a learning guide in `/docs/week-X.md`
- Each week has a hands-on lab in GitHub Issues (see **Issues**)
- You complete tasks via **PRs** and share learnings in **Discussions**
- Use the **Daily Reflection** issue to capture usage, time saved, and pain points

## Quick start (participants)
1. Open `/docs/participant-quickstart.md`
2. Complete the **Week 1 Lab** issue
3. Create a PR for your changes
4. Post one takeaway in Discussions

## What you'll practice
- Prompting patterns (comment-to-code, refactor, tests, docs, debugging)
- Using Copilot for workflows: scaffolding, conversion, maintenance
- DevOps + QA (CI/CD, tests, validation)
- Refactoring legacy code + ethical/security guardrails

## Ground rules
- Don't paste secrets, credentials, customer data, or proprietary code you're not allowed to share.
- Prefer small, well-scoped prompts and verify outputs with tests and reviews.
