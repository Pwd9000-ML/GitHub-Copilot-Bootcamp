# Week 2 — Advanced Development & Support Use Cases (2–4h)

## Topics
- Prompting for explanations and maintainable code
- Generating code aligned to org standards (see `/docs/org-standards/`)
- Security-minded prompting (threats, validation, least privilege)
- Documentation generation and refinement

## Workshop (recommended)
- Implement a feature + docs + tests
- Ask Copilot to propose security checks and justify them
- Capture: what prompts worked + what failed
