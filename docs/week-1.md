  1) explain a function in `sample-app/backend-ts/src/`
  2) generate a small helper function with tests

## Session 2 (1h): Developer workflow use cases
- Code completion + conversion
- Debugging with Copilot Chat
- Scaffolding new features from requirements

### Lab (assigned)
Complete the **Week 1 Lab** issue:
