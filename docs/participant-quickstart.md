# Participant Quickstart

## Prereqs
- GitHub Copilot enabled for your account (ask your admin if unsure)
- VS Code or JetBrains IDE
- Copilot + Copilot Chat extensions enabled

## Recommended workflow during labs
1. Start from the lab issue for the week
2. Create a branch: `week-X/<your-name>`
3. Work in small commits
4. Open a PR and request review (pair up if possible)
5. Add a comment to your PR: what you prompted + what you changed

## Prompting basics
- Give context: goal + constraints + file names
- Ask for small chunks (one function, one test file)
- Ask Copilot to explain "why" and list assumptions
- Validate with tests and linters
